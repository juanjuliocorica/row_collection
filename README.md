This Dart package offers developers a streamlined library of Flutter widgets, useful for displaying information in a row-based layout.
As the baseline widget, there's the `RowItem` widget. It offers a multitude of options:
* **Text information:** Useful when the associated value can be represented with a simple `Text` widget.
* **Boolean information:** Useful when the associated value with a `boolean` value, which can be represented with an icon.
* **Interactive information:** It allows the associated value, in this case a `Text` widget, to be clickable by the user.

This library offers ways to separate this and other interface elements, using the already-implemented `Separator` class:
* **Spacers:** This kind of elements helps to separate UI elements, such as `RowItem` widgets.
* **Dividers:** Helpful when you want to emphasize separation between sections.
* **Empty elements:** Useful when you need to use an 'empty' widget, with `height` & `width` values equal to `0`.

Both kind of widgets (`RowItem` & `Separator`) offer ways to be customizable. For instance, you can use the `style` parameter in the `RowItem` widgets to select a custom text theme.
